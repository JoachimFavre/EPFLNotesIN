I made this document for my own use, but I thought that typed notes might be of interest to others. So, I shared it (with you, if you are reading this!); since it did not cost me anything. I just ask you to keep in mind that there are mistakes, it is impossible not to make any. If you find some, please feel free to share them with me (grammatical and vocabulary errors are of course also welcome). You can contact me at the following e-mail address:

Please note that the content does not belong to me. I have made some structural changes, reworded some parts, and added some personal notes; but the wording and explanations come mainly from the Professor, and from the book on which they based their course.

I think it is worth mentioning that in order to get these notes typed up, I took my notes in \LaTeX during the course, and then made some corrections. I do not think typing handwritten notes is doable in terms of the amount of work. To take notes in \LaTeX, I took my inspiration from the following link, written by Gilles Castel. If you want more details, feel free to contact me at my e-mail address, mentioned hereinabove.

I would also like to specify that the words ``trivial'' and ``simple'' do not have, in this course, the definition you find in a dictionary. We are at EPFL, nothing we do is trivial. Something trivial is something that a random person in the street would be able to do. In our context, understand these words more as ``simpler than the rest''. Also, it is okay if you take a while to understand something that is said to be trivial.

Since you are reading this, I will take give you a little advice. Sleep is a much more powerful tool than you may imagine, so never neglect a good night of sleep in favour of studying (especially the night before the exam). I will also take the liberty of paraphrasing my high school philosophy teacher, Ms. Marques, I hope you will have fun during your exams!

Finally, I would like to thank Paul Tissot-Daguette who did a lot of proofreading of this document. The latter is still not perfect, but it is more readable than it would have been if Paul had not helped me.
